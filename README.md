# Parallax-Website
Made my first Parallax Effect Website in the Class #CSS BASICS 3 &amp; 4 of DOT Batch by @lovebabbar

Before making this, I learned :
✔️CSS Flexbox  and its properties.
✔️Flex-container, flex-items and it's properties.
✔️3D and 2D Transforms.
✔️Position Properties.

and put all of this into action to create simple HTML page to produce this stunning💫
website.
